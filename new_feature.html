              We call healthy meals that keep you full and that you can make a habit your “Go-To” meals. By “healthy,” we mean meals with Protein, Fiber and Healthy Fats like olive oil, nuts, seeds and avocados. Even saturated fats are OK in moderation, especially eggs. It means meals with less added sugar and other processed carbs. Our goal is for you to make those meals (not just eating them but also shopping for and preparing them) part of your weekly routine so that you don’t even need to think about them.
            </p><p>
              You can set a Go-To meal for breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner in the app by touching the pencil icon to the right of the Go To button

                Meals you make at home, e.g., a lunch you make and bring to work, are usually healthier than pre-made meals like frozen dinners, and even those are healthier than what you’ll end up eating at most restaurants. If you want to find yourself less often at a fast food restaurant or eating a frozen pizza, it will help a lot to think about that BEFORE you are hungry and stressed out with no good alternatives. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We provide a simple tool on the app’s Meals page called “Choose Meal Source” to help you do this basic planning. For each meal you can choose between Homemade, Store Bought or Dine Out. If you plan a given meal and then later log what you actually did for that meal, you will be able to see how often you are sticking to your plans on the Goals page.
